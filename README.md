# A Book Tracker App
### App Functionality
#### In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

####    Currently Reading

####    Want to Read

####    Read

#### Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.
The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
